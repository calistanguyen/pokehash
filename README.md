# pokehash
A Pokedex that is implemented with a hash table. The pokehash will include the pokemon's name, number, weight, type(s), abilities, and a brief description. Descriptions of the original Pokemon are from the Pokemon.com website. 

To run the program, execute it with a .tsv file name of your choice - this file keeps a record of all the Pokemon you added into the PokeHash, so whenever you run the program with the file name, the pokemon you added previously will already be loaded into the PokeHash.
